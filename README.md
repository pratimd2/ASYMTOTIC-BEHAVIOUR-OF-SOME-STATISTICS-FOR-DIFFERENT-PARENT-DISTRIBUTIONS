# ASYMTOTIC-BEHAVIOUR-OF-SOME-STATISTICS-FOR-DIFFERENT-PARENT-DISTRIBUTIONS
The objective of this project is 1) Checking asymptotic convergence in probability and distribution of some statistics from parent population like Normal Exponential and Cauchy distribution.  2) Computing "Guess limit" of the statistics through "R" (if it exists). 3)Keeping replication number fixed, increasing sample size and Keeping sample size fixed increasing replication number checking the asymptotic behaviour of the statistics through "R" for the same parameter of the parent population  4) Keeping both sample size and parent population fixed the parameters of the parent population are changed and asymptotic behaviour of the statistics are observed through "R" software.
